# Intelligent-Headlights-Control-Systems---GROUP-4
Intelligent Headlight Control System: an Arduino prototype with an LDR for ambient light sensing and an HC‑SR04 ultrasonic sensor for vehicle detection. It uses PWM to adjust LED brightness, reducing glare and improving night‑time safety. Simulated and tested in Tinkercad. https://youtu.be/wJDx63BAaQE
